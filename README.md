# gdl90
Basic GDL90 tester.

Cobble together a very basic GDL90 (over WiFi) tester using AvareX code (thanks ZK) as a base, with additional decoding and instrumentation.

Use heavy Flutter framwork (as AvareX), but wanted a stand-alone tool for Android (my use case).  Perhaps this instrumentation will work back into
AvareX at some point, if ZK allows it...
